**Subject:** Stop Losing Orders to Complicated Apps - Try OrderOctopus (Free MVP Access)

---

**Body:**

Hi [Restaurant Owner Name],

I'm reaching out because I've been speaking with restaurant owners across [Singapore/Vietnam/Philippines], and I keep hearing the same frustrations:

**Your customers complain** that ordering via those QR code apps takes 8+ minutes when it should take 2. They get frustrated with confusing menus, endless dropdowns, and app downloads. Many give up and wait for staff instead - defeating the whole purpose.

**Your staff is stretched thin.** When you're already short-staffed, having to explain the same menu modifications, dietary options, and specials over and over eats into valuable time. And with high turnover, training new staff on all the menu details, customer preferences, and how to handle special requests is exhausting.

**Language barriers create friction.** Tourists and expats struggle to communicate their orders, staff struggle to understand, and mistakes happen - leading to unhappy customers and wasted food.

**Your menu changes constantly.** Items sell out, prices change, specials rotate - but updating those clunky QR apps is a hassle. So customers order things you don't have, creating more headaches.

**High-maintenance customers need attention.** The guests with allergies, dietary restrictions, or very specific preferences ("extra crispy," "no garlic," "make it spicy") - they deserve great service, but they take up so much staff bandwidth when you're busy.

## What if ordering could be as easy as chatting with a friend?

That's what we're building with **OrderOctopus** 🐙

Imagine this:
- **Your customers scan a QR code** at their table and instantly start chatting on **Facebook Messenger** (no app download needed)
- They can **say what they're craving** in their own language - "I want a burger without onions" or "什么辣的?" - and our AI understands
- It **asks clarifying questions**, suggests combos, and gets the order perfect
- The order appears in **your staff's Messenger group** for approval
- Your team reviews and approves with one tap
- The customer gets confirmation - all in **under 2 minutes**

**And the magic part?** The AI handles:
- ✅ All the menu questions and modifications
- ✅ Upselling combos and specials
- ✅ Multiple languages automatically (English, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Malay)
- ✅ Dietary requirements and special requests
- ✅ Customer hand-holding so your staff doesn't have to

---

## Why This Works Better

**Your customers love it** because:
- They use Messenger - familiar, no app to download
- Natural conversation, not confusing forms
- Works in their language
- Fast - under 2 minutes to order

**Your staff loves it** because:
- Fewer interruptions during rush hours
- AI handles the repetitive questions
- Easy approval workflow (just tap ✅ or ❌)
- Works on phones they already use
- New staff don't need to memorize everything

**You love it** because:
- Mark items sold out with a simple message - instant updates
- Change prices anytime for free
- No more "sorry, we don't have that" after customers order
- Pay per order, not monthly fees (only 1 credit ≈ $0.15-0.20 per order)
- Staff can focus on hospitality, not order-taking

## We're Looking for 3-5 Restaurants for Our MVP

We're launching OrderOctopus in [Singapore/Vietnam/Philippines] and looking for forward-thinking restaurant owners to test the system before our official launch.

**What you get:**
- ✅ **25 free orders** to test the system (worth $5)
- ✅ **Free menu setup** - we'll import your menu from PDF or help you set it up
- ✅ **White-glove onboarding** - we'll guide you through everything
- ✅ **Priority support** - direct line to our team
- ✅ **Early bird pricing** - lock in discounted credit packages
- ✅ **Your feedback shapes the product** - we're building this FOR you

**What we need from you:**
- A restaurant with table service (dine-in)
- Willingness to test for 2-3 weeks
- Honest feedback on what works and what doesn't
- A few hours to set up and train your team

---

## How It Works (Simple Setup)

1. **Week 1:** We set up your menu, generate QR codes, and train you + your staff (2-3 hours total)
2. **Week 2-3:** Your customers start ordering via Messenger, your team approves orders
3. **Ongoing:** We gather feedback, fix issues, and improve based on YOUR needs

---

## Real Talk: Is This Right for You?

**This is perfect if:**
- You serve 20+ tables per day
- Customers often have questions or modifications
- You struggle with staff training or turnover
- You serve international customers or tourists
- You want to increase orders without hiring more staff

**This might NOT be right if:**
- You prefer face-to-face ordering only
- Your menu is extremely simple (3-4 items, no modifications)
- You don't use smartphones/Messenger for your business
- You're uncomfortable with new technology

## Follow-Up Email (If No Response After 5-7 Days)

**Subject:** Re: OrderOctopus MVP - Still Interested?

---

Hi [Name],

I sent you an email last week about OrderOctopus - our chat-based ordering system that helps restaurants handle more orders with less staff.

I know you're busy running your restaurant, so I'll keep this super short:

**If you're interested:** Reply with "Yes" and your available times for a quick 15-min call.

**If timing isn't right:** No problem! Should I follow up in a few months when things are calmer?

**If it's not a fit:** Just let me know and I'll stop bothering you 😊

Thanks for your time,

[Your Name]

## LinkedIn/Social Media Outreach Version

Hi [Name],

I noticed you run [Restaurant Name] - the [specific dish/aspect] looks amazing!

I'm working on something that might interest you: **OrderOctopus**, a chat-based ordering system that lets customers order via Messenger instead of those slow QR apps.

We're looking for 3-5 restaurants in [City] to test the MVP (25 free orders included).

Would you be open to a quick 15-min chat to see if it's a fit?

---

## Phone Script (If Cold Calling)

**Opening:**
"Hi, is this [Name]? My name is [Your Name], I'm reaching out to restaurant owners in [City] about a new ordering system that helps handle more customers with less staff. Do you have 2 minutes?"

**If Yes:**
"Great! Quick question - do you currently use any QR code ordering system, or do customers mostly order with staff?"

[Listen to their answer]

"I hear you. We're building something called OrderOctopus - it's like WhatsApp/Messenger for ordering. Customers chat with an AI that understands their language and handles all the menu questions, then sends orders to your staff for approval. Takes under 2 minutes.

We're looking for 3-5 restaurants to test it - you'd get 25 free orders and we'd set everything up for you. Would you be interested in seeing a quick demo this week?"

**If No Time:**
"No problem! Can I send you a quick email with more info and we can chat when you're less busy?"

## Response Templates

### When They Say "I'm Interested"
"Fantastic! Let me ask a few quick questions to make sure it's a good fit:
1. How many tables do you serve per day typically?
2. Do you currently use any ordering system?
3. What's your biggest frustration with taking orders right now?
4. When would be a good time for a 15-min demo call?"

### When They Say "How Much Does It Cost?"
"Great question! For the MVP, you get 25 free orders to test it. After that, it's credit-based - about $0.15-0.20 per order. So if you do 100 orders, that's about $15-20. No monthly fees, no contracts. Only pay for orders you actually get.

Does that pricing make sense for your business?"

### When They Say "I'm Too Busy"
"I totally understand - restaurant life is non-stop! That's actually exactly why OrderOctopus helps - it takes work OFF your plate, not adds to it.

How about this: I'll send you a 2-minute video demo. If it looks interesting, we can find 15 minutes next week. If not, no worries. Sound fair?"

### When They Say "Let Me Think About It"
"Absolutely, take your time. Can I ask - what would you need to see or know to feel comfortable trying it?

[Listen, address concerns]

How about I follow up in [3 days/1 week]? Would email or WhatsApp work better?"

### When They Say "We Don't Have Budget"
"Good news - for the MVP, it's basically free to try! You get 25 orders on us. If you like it after that, you only pay per order (around $0.15 each). So if it doesn't work, you haven't spent anything.

And honestly, if it saves your staff even 30 minutes per shift, it pays for itself. Worth a test?"

- Referencing a recent review or social media post
- Noting if they already use technology (online ordering, delivery apps)
- Acknowledging their specific market (tourist area, business district, local neighborhood)
- Using their language preference if known

**Example:**
"I saw your recent post about the new spicy noodle special - looks incredible! I also noticed you serve a lot of tourists based on your reviews. I think OrderOctopus could really help with the language barriers..."
